<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Water Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Storage</li><li>Non-storage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric water heaters can be classified into two main types: storage and non-storage heaters. Storage heaters store and heat a fixed amount of water in a tank, ready for use whenever needed. They are suitable for households with high hot water demand. Non-storage heaters, also known as tankless or instant water heaters, heat water on demand without the need for a storage tank. They are more energy-efficient and space-saving, making them ideal for small households or areas with limited space. Both types serve the purpose of providing hot water but differ in terms of storage and heating methods.</p></p>
