<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rail Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavy Rail</li><li>Light Rail</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heavy rail typically refers to large, high-capacity urban train systems, such as subways and commuter trains, that operate on dedicated tracks and are separate from pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Light rail, on the other hand, comprises smaller, lower-capacity trains that run on street-level tracks and often share lanes with cars and pedestrians, serving as a more cost-effective and flexible option for urban and suburban areas. Both heavy and light rail systems play essential roles in providing efficient and convenient public transportation options for commuters.</p></p>
