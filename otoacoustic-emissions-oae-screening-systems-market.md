<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions</li><li>Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) screening systems are used to assess the functioning of the cochlea in the inner ear. There are two main types of OAE screening systems: Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE). TEOAE tests involve a brief sound stimulus, while DPOAE tests use two tones to create a response. Both types of screening systems are effective in detecting hearing loss in individuals, making them valuable tools in audiology and hearing healthcare.</p></p>
