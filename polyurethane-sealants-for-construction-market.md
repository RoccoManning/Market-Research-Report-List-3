<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Sealants for Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Component</li><li>Multi Component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane sealants for construction come in two main types: single component and multi-component. Single component sealants are ready to use out of the package and cure on exposure to moisture in the air. On the other hand, multi-component sealants require mixing of separate components before application. Single-component sealants are more convenient for quick tasks, while multi-component sealants offer better control and can be customized for specific applications. Both types offer excellent adhesion, flexibility, and durability for construction projects.</p></p>
