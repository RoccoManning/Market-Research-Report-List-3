<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflow Oven for PCB and Semiconductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Reflow Oven</li><li>Vapour Phase Reflow Oven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflow ovens are used in the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and semiconductors to solder components onto the boards. Convection reflow ovens use heated air circulating inside the oven to melt the solder and create strong connections. Vapor phase reflow ovens, on the other hand, use a controlled vapor bubble that condenses on the PCB, transferring heat to melt the solder. While both types achieve the same goal of soldering components, they differ in the method used to heat the solder and achieve reliable connections.</p></p>
