<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulsed Radar</li><li>Continuous Wave (CW) Radar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>RADAR technology is used for detecting and tracking objects by emitting radio waves and analyzing their reflections. Pulsed Radar operates by sending out short bursts of radio waves and then analyzing the return signals. It is used for long-range detection and accurate measurement. Continuous Wave (CW) Radar, on the other hand, continuously emits radio waves and measures the frequency change in the reflections to calculate an object's velocity. CW Radar is more suitable for short-range applications like speed guns and collision avoidance systems. Both types serve different purposes and find applications in various industries.</p></p>
