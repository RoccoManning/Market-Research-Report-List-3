<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Phase Current Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-phase current relays are devices used to protect electrical systems from damage caused by over-current or under-current conditions. Under-current detection relays monitor the current flowing through a circuit and activate when the current drops below a certain preset level, indicating a fault or malfunction. On the other hand, over-current detection relays activate when the current exceeds a defined threshold, indicating an overload or short circuit. Both types of relays are essential in preventing electrical equipment damage, ensuring system safety, and maintaining efficient electrical operations.</p></p>
