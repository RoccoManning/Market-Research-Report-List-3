<p><strong>The Choke and Kill Manifold Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Choke Manifold</li><li>Kill Manifold</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Choke and Kill Manifold market types include Choke Manifold and Kill Manifold. A Choke Manifold is used to control wellbore pressure during drilling operations to prevent blowouts. It regulates the flow of drilling fluid to maintain optimal pressure levels. On the other hand, a Kill Manifold is used to pump heavy fluids or mud into the wellbore to kill the well and control abnormal pressure. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining well control and preventing potential accidents in the oil and gas industry.</p></p>
