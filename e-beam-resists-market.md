<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive E-beam Resists</li><li>Negative E-beam Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>E-beam resists are used in the semiconductor industry for lithography processes. Positive E-beam resists are sensitive to the e-beam and become more soluble after exposure, while negative E-beam resists become less soluble. Positive E-beam resists are used to create patterns where the exposed areas are removed, while negative E-beam resists are used to create patterns where the unexposed areas are removed. Both types are essential for fabricating intricate semiconductor devices and circuits.</p></p>
