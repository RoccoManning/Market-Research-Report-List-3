<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scroll Centrifuge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-Phase Scroll Centrifuge</li><li>Three-Phase Scroll Centrifuge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Scroll Centrifuge market consists of two main types: the Two-Phase Scroll Centrifuge and the Three-Phase Scroll Centrifuge. The Two-Phase Scroll Centrifuge is used for separating a mixture that contains two different liquid phases, such as oil and water. It operates by creating a high-speed rotating motion that causes the heavier liquid to settle at the bottom and the lighter liquid to rise to the top. On the other hand, the Three-Phase Scroll Centrifuge is designed to separate a mixture of three different liquid phases, providing more efficient separation and processing capabilities.</p></p>
