<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Non invasive Ventilator NIV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilator</li><li>BIPAP Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sleep Non-invasive Ventilators are devices used to assist patients in breathing while they sleep. The two main types of NIV ventilators are CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) and BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) ventilators. CPAP ventilators deliver a constant level of air pressure to keep the airways open, while BiPAP ventilators deliver two levels of air pressure - higher pressure when inhaling and lower pressure when exhaling. Both types of ventilators are commonly used to treat sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders.</p></p>
