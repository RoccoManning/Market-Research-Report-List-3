<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The KF Titrator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulometric Titration</li><li>Volumetric Titration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The KF Titrator market consists of two main types: Coulometric Titration and Volumetric Titration. Coulometric Titration involves the measurement of electric current required to generate iodine, which reacts with water present in the sample. This method is best for low water content analysis. Volumetric Titration, on the other hand, relies on the addition of a reagent containing iodine to the sample, and the measurement of the volume of reagent needed to reach a set endpoint. This method is suitable for both low and high water content analysis. Each type caters to different water content requirements of various industries.</p></p>
