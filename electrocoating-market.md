<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrocoating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cathodic</li><li>Anodic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrocoating, also known as e-coating, is a method of applying a paint or coating to a conductive surface using an electrical current. There are two main types of electrocoating markets: cathodic and anodic. In cathodic electrocoating, the part being coated is negatively charged and attracts positively charged paint particles, leading to a more uniform and durable coating. In contrast, anodic electrocoating involves the part being positively charged, which attracts negatively charged paint particles. Both methods have their own set of advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
