<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Domestic Smoke Alarms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionisation Type</li><li>Photoelectric Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ionisation type smoke alarms detect smoke particles by using a small amount of radioactive material to ionize the air inside the alarm. When smoke enters the alarm, it disrupts the electrical current and triggers the alarm. These types of alarms are best at detecting fast-flaming fires. On the other hand, photoelectric type smoke alarms use a light source and a photocell. When smoke particles enter the alarm, they scatter the light, triggering the alarm. These alarms are more effective at detecting slow-smoldering fires. Both types of smoke alarms are important for ensuring the safety of homes and residents.</p></p>
