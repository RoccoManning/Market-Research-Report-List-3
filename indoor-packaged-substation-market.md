<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indoor Packaged Substation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-Filled Transformers</li><li>Dry Type Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The indoor packaged substation market consists of two main types: Liquid-Filled Transformers and Dry Type Transformers. Liquid-filled transformers use oil or other types of liquid as an insulating medium and coolant. They are commonly used in high voltage applications due to their excellent cooling properties. On the other hand, dry type transformers do not require a liquid coolant and use air to cool the windings. They are preferred in areas where fire safety is a concern. Both types cater to different market needs and have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p></p>
