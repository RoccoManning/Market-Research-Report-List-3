<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft DC-DC Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated DC-DC Converters</li><li>Non-isolated DC-DC Converters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aircraft DC-DC Converter market can be divided into two types: Isolated DC-DC Converters and Non-isolated DC-DC Converters. Isolated DC-DC Converters are designed to provide electrical isolation between the input and output, which helps in preventing disturbances in the aircraft's electrical systems. On the other hand, Non-isolated DC-DC Converters do not provide electrical isolation and are mainly used in applications where isolation is not necessary. Both types serve different purposes and cater to the specific requirements of the aircraft industry.</p></p>
