<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigeration Tunnel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Air-cooling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The refrigeration tunnel market consists of two main types: liquid cooling and air cooling. Liquid cooling involves the use of a liquid coolant, such as chilled water or a refrigerant, to maintain low temperatures inside the tunnel. This type of cooling is generally more efficient and effective at removing heat compared to air cooling. On the other hand, air cooling relies on the circulation of cool air to regulate the temperature in the tunnel. While air cooling may be less efficient, it can be a more cost-effective option for certain applications.</p></p>
