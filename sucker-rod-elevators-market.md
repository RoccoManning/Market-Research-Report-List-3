<p><strong>The Sucker Rod Elevators Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No-corrosion Oil Well</li><li>Corrosive Oil Well</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sucker rod elevators, commonly used in the oil and gas industry, have specific applications in two types of oil wells. They find their utility in no-corrosion oil wells, where the elevators are used to handle sucker rods without rusting or getting corroded due to the non-corrosive nature of the well fluids. Similarly, in corrosive oil wells, these elevators are employed to prevent corrosion caused by the presence of corrosive well fluids, thereby ensuring the safe and efficient handling of sucker rods in both types of oil wells.</p></p>
