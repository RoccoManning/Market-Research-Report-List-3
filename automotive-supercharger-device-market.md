<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-screw Supercharger</li><li>Centrifugal Supercharges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive supercharger device market is broadly categorized into two main types: twin-screw superchargers and centrifugal superchargers. Twin-screw superchargers use two tightly intermeshing screws to compress air and deliver it to the engine, providing efficient and consistent power. On the other hand, centrifugal superchargers utilize a radial flow compressor to increase air pressure before it enters the engine, offering high power outputs at higher engine speeds. Both types of superchargers are popular choices for boosting engine performance in vehicles.</p></p>
