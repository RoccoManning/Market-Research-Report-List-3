<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CNG Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Reciprocating Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>CNG compressors are used for the compression of compressed natural gas (CNG) to optimize storage and transportation. Rotary-type compressors utilize rotating elements and are known for their continuous and smooth operation, making them suitable for high volumes of gas. On the other hand, reciprocating-type compressors employ piston-cylinder mechanisms and are characterized by intermittent compression. While rotary compressors are well-suited for large-scale applications, reciprocating compressors have advantages in smaller installations due to their lower initial costs and ability to handle variable loads. Both types serve the purpose of compressing CNG for efficient storage and transportation.</p></p>
